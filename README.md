# Breast Cancer Detection & Segmentation Using Deep Learning

Breast cancer has the second highest mortality rate in women next to lung cancer. According to the global cancer statics, the number of new cases in 2018 was estimated to be 18,078,957 and deaths 9,555,027 (52.85%) globally. The cases of breast cancer amounts to 2,088,849 (11.55%) and the deaths is estimated to be 626,679 (6.56%). 60% of the deaths occur in low income developing countries like Ethiopia. If the cancer is detected early, it increases expectancy of survival rate/mortality of patient. Existence of breast cancer can be indicated through many abnormalities such as masses, micro-calcifications and areas of symmetry and distortion. Among these, masses are the most representative and common lesion type.

## Problem Statemenet

To develop an automated system for detection and segmentation of tumours using mammograms in Cranial-Caudal and Medial-lateral oblique (CC and MLO) views using Deep Learning Techniques.

## Objectives

The main objectives of our project revolve around the classification of tumors as Benign and Malignant and then to detect location of the tumour by segmenting the lesions in an abnormal mammogram. Finally, to evaluate the performance of various Deep Learning approaches for detection and segmentation of tumours.

## Getting Started

### Datasets

The input dataset was divided into two categories i.e training dataset and test dataset. Training dataset includes the images which were trained with four models while test dataset was the one which provided unbiased evaluation of the model on the training dataset.
The dataset used in our work can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18bmhjPMxoxsKh08cg8nRvqiz17kvvlEI?usp=sharing).

### Dependencies

* Software: Tensorflow & Keras/Pytorch/Pycharm
* Hardware: Intel Core i7,8th Gen Processor,Windows 10, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD. Google Collab.
